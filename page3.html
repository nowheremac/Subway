        <p>I mean look you're paying $2.75 or $3 for a crowded, dirty, smelly cart to get to where you need to go. On the other hand people have to take the subway since they don't have any other choice. It would only be fair for people to put the price a little down. Mostly a lot of people that take the subway don't even pay and hop it.</p>
